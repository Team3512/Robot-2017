# FRC Team 3512's 2017 Robot

Source code for the 2017 competition robot: Antikythera

Source code also for the 2017 practice robot: Hyperion

## Game

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by transporting gears to the airship and shooting fuel (balls) into the boiler. We didn't build a shooter because we haven't built consistent ones yet and the point trade-off wasn't worth it. We decided that the two main ways of obtaining points were to hang the gear via GPU (Gear Picker Upper. Yes, we understand this name is cringey) and to climb a rope via a winch. In autonomous, the main goal was to hang a gear.

## 2017 Unique Features

This years robot's unique features include:

- Autonoumous with superimposed PID controllers controlling the position and heading
- Hot-swappable camera streams
- Pneumatic code galore
- Simple winch code
